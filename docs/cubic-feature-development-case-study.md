# 🚀 Cubic Power Feature Development Case Study

## Overview

This case study demonstrates the complete lifecycle of adding a new feature (cubic power operation) to the Calculator API, showing how it flows through Development → Staging → Production environments in a modern CI/CD pipeline.

## 📋 Feature Specification

**Feature**: Add cubic power operation to calculator API
**Operation**: `cubic`
**Description**: Raise a number to the power of 3
**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/calculator/calculate`
**Parameters**: `{"operation": "cubic", "a": number}`

### Examples
- `2³ = 8`
- `(-3)³ = -27`
- `0³ = 0`
- `1.5³ = 3.375`

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Development Environment

### 1.1 Feature Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-cubic-power
```

### 1.2 Code Implementation

#### A. Update Data Models (`app/api/models/calculator.py`)
```python
# Added 'cubic' to operation Literal types
operation: Literal[
    "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "power", "sqrt", "abs_diff", "cubic"
] = Field(..., description="Mathematical operation to perform")

# Updated validation rules
@validator("b")
def validate_second_operand(cls, v, values):
    """Validate second operand based on operation"""
    operation = values.get("operation")
    if operation not in ["sqrt", "cubic"] and v is None:
        raise ValueError("Second operand is required for this operation")
    return v
```

#### B. Implement Business Logic (`app/api/services/calculator_service.py`)
```python
elif operation == "cubic":
    # Cubic power: raise number to power of 3
    result = math.pow(a, 3)
```

#### C. Update API Routes (`app/api/routes/calculator.py`)
```python
OperationInfo(
    name="cubic",
    symbol="³",
    description="Raise number to the power of 3 (cubic)",
    parameters=["a"],
),
```

### 1.3 Unit Testing (`tests/unit/test_calculator_service.py`)
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_cubic_operation(self, calculator_service, mock_session):
    """Test cubic power operation"""
    # Test positive number
    result = await calculator_service.calculate("cubic", 2, None, mock_session)
    assert result == 8.0

    # Test negative number
    result = await calculator_service.calculate("cubic", -3, None, mock_session)
    assert result == -27.0

    # Test zero
    result = await calculator_service.calculate("cubic", 0, None, mock_session)
    assert result == 0.0

    # Test decimal number
    result = await calculator_service.calculate("cubic", 1.5, None, mock_session)
    assert result == 3.375
```

### 1.4 Local Testing Results
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
# Results: 18 passed, 1 warning in 1.42s
```

### 1.5 Code Review & Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add cubic power operation to calculator API"
git push origin feature/add-cubic-power
# Create Pull Request to master branch
